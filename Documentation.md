# Documentation for Music Player project:

-The Music Player is a simple Python application that allows users to play music files using a graphical user interface (GUI). The application is based on the Tkinter library, which provides the widgets and functionality for building the GUI.

-The Music Player application uses the Pygame library to play music files in the background. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games and multimedia applications.

## Installation:

- Before running the Music Player, make sure that Python and Pygame are installed on your system. To install Pygame, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

`pip install pygame`

## Usage:

To use the Music Player, simply run the script in a Python environment. A window will appear with a "Select" button, which allows you to choose a music file to play. Once a file has been selected, you can use the "Play", "Pause", and "Stop" buttons to control the playback.

The progress bar at the bottom of the window shows the current position of the playback and the total duration of the music file. The label above the progress bar shows the current time in minutes and seconds and the total time in minutes and seconds.

To select a file to play, click on the "Select" button and choose a music file from your local file system. Once a file has been selected, the file path will be displayed in the label below the "Select" button.

To start playing the music file, click on the "Play" button. The music will start playing from the beginning of the file. If you click on the "Play" button while the music is already playing, the music will continue playing from its current position.

To pause the music, click on the "Pause" button. The music will pause and the current position will be saved.

To stop the music, click on the "Stop" button. The music will stop playing and the progress bar will be reset to zero.

The progress bar updates in real-time as the music is playing. The label above the progress bar shows the current time in minutes and seconds and the total time in minutes and seconds.

## Classes and methods:

- The MusicPlayer class contains the following methods:

1. init(self, master): Initializes the MusicPlayer object and creates the GUI.
2. select_file(self): Opens a file dialog box and allows the user to select a music file to play.
3. play(self): Starts playing the music file.
4. pause(self): Pauses the music file.
5. stop(self): Stops the music file.
6. update_progress(self): Updates the progress bar and label with the current position and duration of the music file.
7. format_time(self, time_in_seconds): Formats a time in seconds into a string in the format "MM:SS".

## Limitations:

The Music Player has some limitations that may be addressed in future updates:

- The application only supports a limited number of music file formats. Only files in WAV and MP3 format can be played.
- The application does not have a playlist feature. Users can only play one music file at a time.
- The application does not have a volume control feature. Users must adjust the volume using the system volume control.
